Prune annually in late winter to encourage new growth and maintain shape. Protect from birds with netting when fruits are ripening. Harvest berries when they are deep purple and fully ripe, typically in late summer or early fall. Always cook elderberries before consumption, as raw berries can cause digestive upset.');

Known for its large, round fruits filled with seeds (arils) surrounded by a thick, leathery skin, pomegranates are prized for their sweet-tart flavor and high antioxidant content. The fruit is used in juices, culinary dishes, and has significant cultural and historical importance in many regions.', 'Pomegranates thrive in full sun and require well-draining, slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH between 5.5-7.0. They are drought-tolerant once established but produce better fruit with consistent moisture. Water deeply but infrequently, providing 1-1.5 inches of water per week during the growing season. In cooler zones, plant in a protected location or use a container that can be moved indoors during winter. Prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead or crossing branches. Fertilize with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring. Protect from extreme cold and frost. Thin fruits when they are small to improve size and quality of remaining pomegranates. Harvest when fruits develop a deep, rich color and make a metallic sound when tapped.');
